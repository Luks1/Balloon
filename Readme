first store my oder in array
store my prices also in array
then split both separately
then am removing "sets of" by replacing it by space
and store them into an array
I have to find out how many balloons for each sets by multiplying each set by 3
Calculating the cost of all balloons
calculating extra cost if its R2 for each
then have to find out that i can have any spare if 25 people can come
